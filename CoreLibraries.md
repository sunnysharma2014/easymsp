The core libraries are the foundation of EasyMSP. The core libraries are:

  * EasyMSP
  * System
  * IO
  * Watchdog
  * Flash<sup>1</sup>

> <sup>1</sup> Flash is not a core library in a technical sense, as it builds upon others, but it is still a essential library that others build on.

These core libraries build the foundation for other libraries to build onto.
