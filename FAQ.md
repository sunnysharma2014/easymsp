## I've heard rumors about EasyMSP being abandoned or dead. Is this true? ##

No. EasyMSP is still active and in development.

## Is EasyMSP related to Arduino or Wiring? ##

No. EasyMSP is not related to the Arduino or wiring platform, Nor do i intend for EasyMSP to be like the Arduino or Wiring platforms. It is a completely different breed.

## In the past, EasyMSP had support for Arduino code right? ##

Yes, it did. EasyMSP had something called AFI, or Arduino Function Interface. However, the AFI has been removed due to issues relating to compatibility and usability.

Not yet. I have been experimenting on a Windows only editor.

## This project has been active for already two years, Why isn't there a stable release? ##

Many issues, have caused development to stop for months at a time. I apologize for the inconvenience. A release should be just around the corner.
